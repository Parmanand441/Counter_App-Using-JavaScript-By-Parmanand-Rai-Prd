# Counter_App-Using-JavaScript-By-Parmanand-Rai-Prd
I have created a counter application using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript where I've add three buttons, one for increment, other one for decrement and the last and third one for reset, when you click on increment the value will increase and when you click on decrease the value will decrease and when you click on reset the value will be zero.
